                  This demo shows you how changes to the{" "}
                  <strong>DID Registry</strong> impact how your users will
                  experience logging in to your dApp.

                  When you connect your wallet to this dApp in Step #1 below,
                  the dApp automatically checks the DID Registry to see if you
                  are eligible to purchase. If your wallet address is in the DID
                  Registry and you are in the KYC List, then you are eligible to
                  purchase.
                  <NewLine />
                  <NewLine />
                  You can use Step #2 below to update the DID Registry. If your
                  wallet address is not in the DID Registry, you can add it. If
                  you are not in the KYC List, you can add yourself. In a
                  similar way, you can remove yourself from the KYC List or
                  remove your wallet address from DID Registry. These are NOT
                  actions your user can take but meant to demonstrate how your
                  dApp can query the DID Registry and you can show or hide
                  actions (like voting or purchasing) based on the status in the
                  DID Registry.
